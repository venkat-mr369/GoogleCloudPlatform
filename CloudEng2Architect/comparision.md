### Key Notes

- **Terraform** is now the preferred infrastructure-as-code tool for Google Cloud, offering more flexibility and features than Deployment Manager.
- You can use Terraform to provision and manage nearly all GCP resources, including enabling and managing Config Connector.
- For most automation and infrastructure management needs on GCP, Terraform is a robust and recommended choice.
